# Authentication Service

## Description

Authentication Service written in Haskell. Not usable yet.

## Roadmap

### Essentials

For completeness:

- key management

For security:

Different list as is this project is for now an experiment. Long list,
implementing which might lead to the conclusion that Haskell is not the
appropriate language to do this in.

### Ideas

- swap PSS for Ed25519 signatures (faster, shorter key lengths),
- harden against timing attacks,
- support for authorization schemes
