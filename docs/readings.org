* Notes

** Use HSTS

1. Add the header Strict-Transport-Security to the response
2. The value is the number of seconds that the browser should only interact with
   the site using HTTPS. [1]

** Set the secure flag in a cookie [1]


** Authenticate user safely
   
- authentication
- authorization
- session management

When a user makes a mistake entering their username or password, we might see a
website respond with a message like this: The user ID is unknown. Revealing
whether a user exists can help an attacker enumerate accounts on our system to
mount further attacks against them or, depending on the nature of the site,
revealing the user has an account may compromise their privacy. A better, more
generic, response might be: Incorrect user ID or password.

** Account data [2]

Often your centralized authentication system will store the following information:

    ID
    first name
    last name
    login/nickname
    email
    hashed password
    salt
    creation timestamp
    update timestamp
    account state (verified, disabled â€¦)

For security reasons, you might want to white list the domains you allow your
authentication app to redirect to. [2]
